## Code Review

This code review is being done with a game called Farkle which was originally written in 2017 in C++.

I will give an overview of the current version of the program to explain the functionality and the attributes and classes that are used.

I will then go through the enhancements that will be completed throughout this Capstone course in the categories of 
- Software Engineering and Design
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Database enhancement.
