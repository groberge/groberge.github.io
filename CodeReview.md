## Code Review

This code review is being done for a game called Farkle which was originally written in C++ which will be used as the base program for multiple enhancements in the Capstone for the BS in Computer Science degreee program.  This was written for the Software Development with C++ .Net course at Southern New Hampshire University.

In this code review, I give an overview of the current version of the program to explain the functionality and the attributes and classes that are used.  I then point out any bugs that I've found in the code along with further improvements that should be made. 

I will then go through the enhancements that will be completed throughout this Capstone course in the categories of 
- Software Engineering and Design
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Database enhancement
