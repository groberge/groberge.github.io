## Code Review

This code review is being done for a game called Farkle which was originally written in C++ for the Software Development with C++ .Net course at Southern New Hampshire University.  This program will be used as the base for multiple enhancements in the Capstone for the BS in Computer Science degreee program.  

In this code review, I give an overview of the current version of the program to explain the functionality as well as the attributes and classes that are used.  I then point out any bugs that I've found in the code along with further improvements that should be made. 

I will then go through the enhancements that will be completed throughout this Capstone course in the categories of 
- Software Engineering and Design
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Database enhancement
